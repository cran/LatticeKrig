\title{
Observed North American summer precipitation from the
historical climate network.
}
\description{
Average rainfall in tenth of millimeters for the months
of June, July and August for the period 1950-2010. Data is based on 
1720 station located in North America.

\format{
  The format is a list with components:
"longitude" "latitude"  "precip"    "elevation" "precipSE" "trend" "trendSE" "type"
with elevation in meters, longitude as (-180,180), latitude as (-90, 90) and precipitaion in 1/10 mm 
( precip/254  converts to inches of rainfall)

\code{precip} is the intercept for 1980.5 when a straight line least squares regression is fit to 
each station's record. SE is the companion standard error from the least squares fit.
If the station is complete, then \code{precip} and \code{precipSE} will just be the mean and standard deviation adjusted for a linear trend. The estimated trend  \code{trend} and and its standard error \code{trendSE} are also included. 
 Also due to the centering, for complete data the intercept and trend estimate will be uncorrelated. The component \code{type} indicates whether the station has been "adjusted" (see below) or is "raw" observations.
